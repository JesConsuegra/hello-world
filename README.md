Hello,
I'm trying to find my way to 3D printing along Freecad and Python programming learning, using open hardware/software.
My first approach has been to recover my old microcontroller design environment (PIC and AVR mainly) and also try the Pyboard with micropython on it.
I have some ideas regarding different ways of 3D printing using the current ABS/PLA technologies, but before doing anything, I have to start by assembling a standard 3D printer at my own and then try the ideas. (Kind a 3D print bootstrap, I need a printer to print my ideas). I've just recovered a stepper motor from an old 5" floppy drive, I'm afraid being unipolar hasn't enough torque to move the assemblies on a PRUSA I3 Hephestos kind of printer (that is my bootstrap target by now). Anyway I'm spending the day trying to figure out how to make the stepper turn. I'm using an old PIC16F84A microcontroller and a ULN2003 open collector driver...
Next I'll try to do the same with the Pyboard, in Python.
